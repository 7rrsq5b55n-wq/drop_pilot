# Privacy Policy — Drop Pilot

*Effective date:* [YYYY-MM-DD]

Drop Pilot (“we”, “us”, “our”) helps delivery drivers plan and navigate multi-stop routes.

## What information we collect
We aim to collect the minimum data needed for the app to work.

### Location data
•⁠  ⁠*When in use:* We use your location to show your position on the map and to create routes from your current position.
•⁠  ⁠*Background (optional):* If you enable background location, we may use it to keep navigation/route tracking working when the app is not in the foreground.

### User-provided data
•⁠  ⁠Addresses you enter, paste, or import (e.g., via CSV) are used to geocode and generate routes.

### Diagnostics
We may collect basic crash logs and performance diagnostics provided by the operating system to improve stability.

## How we use information
We use information to:
•⁠  ⁠Show your current position on the map
•⁠  ⁠Convert addresses into coordinates (geocoding)
•⁠  ⁠Generate routes and estimated ETAs (including traffic, if available)
•⁠  ⁠Improve performance and fix bugs

## Sharing of information
We do not sell your personal data.

We may share limited data with service providers *only to provide app functionality*, such as:
•⁠  ⁠*Google Maps Platform APIs* (geocoding/directions) when you request routing features.

## Data retention
•⁠  ⁠Addresses and stops may be stored on your device to support your route history.
•⁠  ⁠We do not intentionally store your location history on our servers (unless you add a backend later).

## Your choices
•⁠  ⁠You can disable location permissions in iOS Settings.
•⁠  ⁠If you disable location permissions, some features (map position, routing from your current location) may not work.

## Children’s privacy
Drop Pilot is not intended for children under 13.

## Security
We use reasonable safeguards to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Contact
If you have questions, contact us:

## Changes
We may update this policy from time to time. We’ll update the effective date above when changes are made.

# Drop Pilot Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2026-01-23

Drop Pilot (“the App”) helps delivery drivers plan and navigate multi-stop routes. This policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, and your choices.

## 1. Data We Collect
The App may collect or process the following data to provide core functionality:

### Location Data
- **Precise location (foreground):** Used to show your position on the map and to calculate routes.
- **Location (background, if enabled):** Used to continue route tracking while the App is not in the foreground (only if you grant permission and background location is enabled on your device).

### Route & Stop Data (User-Provided)
- Addresses and stop details you add (manually, pasted list, or CSV import).
- Delivery status (e.g., pending/delivered/failed/skipped).
- Optional notes or phone numbers you enter for a stop.

### Diagnostics (Limited)
- Basic error logs may appear on your device during development/testing (e.g., debug console).  
- The production App is intended to avoid collecting personal diagnostics beyond what Apple provides by default unless you explicitly add crash/analytics tooling.

## 2. How We Use Data
We use your data only to:
- Display maps and your current location
- Generate route directions and estimated time/distance (including traffic-aware estimates where supported)
- Help you manage stops and delivery status
- Improve reliability (bug fixing)

## 3. Sharing of Data
- **Google Maps APIs:** The App sends route requests (origin/destination/waypoints) to Google Maps services to retrieve directions/geocoding results. These requests may include location coordinates and stop coordinates.
- We do **not** sell your personal data.
- We do **not** share your personal data with third parties for advertising.

## 4. Data Storage
- Stop/route information may be stored locally on your device (e.g., via local storage) so your route persists.
- If you add cloud sync later, this policy must be updated.

## 5. Your Choices
- You can deny location permissions, but routing/navigation features may not work.
- You can disable background location in iOS Settings at any time.
- You can delete stops/rounds inside the App (local data).

## 6. Security
We take reasonable steps to protect data stored on-device. However, no method of storage is 100% secure.

## 7. Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

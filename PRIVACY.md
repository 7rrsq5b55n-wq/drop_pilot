1. Information We Collect

Depending on the App features you use, we may collect or process:

Usage Data (Analytics)
	•	App interaction data (e.g., screens viewed, feature usage, session duration)

2. How We Use Information

We use information to:

	•	Store and deliver user content (including photos/videos) and enable sharing where applicable
	•	Maintain safety, integrity, and moderation features (where provided)
	•	Improve the Apps (analytics, feature performance, debugging, crash resolution)
	•	Provide support and respond to user requests

3. Service Providers (How Data Is Processed)

We use trusted service providers to operate and improve our Apps. Depending on the App, this may include:

These providers process data on our behalf under their terms and are not permitted to use it for their own advertising for our Apps.

4. Data Sharing
	•	We do not sell personal information.
	•	We do not share personal information with third parties for third-party advertising.
	•	We share data with service providers only as needed to operate app features (e.g., hosting, analytics, crash reporting).

5. Data Storage & Retention
	•	App data and user content may be stored on secure cloud services to support functionality across devices.
	•	We retain data for as long as needed to provide the App and for legitimate purposes such as security, preventing abuse, legal compliance, and backups.
	•	If you delete content or request account deletion, we will take reasonable steps to delete associated data, subject to retention required for legal/security reasons.

	•	You can typically update certain profile information within the App (where available).
	•	You may request account deletion or data access by contacting us (see Contact).

7. Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information. No system is 100% secure.
